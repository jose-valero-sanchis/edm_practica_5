# EDM Practica 5

## Overview

This repository contains the files and code for the EDM Practica 5 project. The main objective of this practice is to explore and analyze the Partial Dependence Plots (PDPs) for different scenarios using Random Forest models. The two primary case studies in this project are bicycle rental forecasting and housing price forecasting.


## Case Studies

### Bicycle Rental Forecasting

The first scenario involves predicting the number of bicycles rented based on meteorological and temporal variables

### Housing Price Forecasting

The second scenario predicts house prices based on several variables as number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms...

    cd edm_practica_5
    ```

3. **Install necessary packages**: Ensure you have the required R packages installed to run the RMarkdown file. You can use the `renv` package to restore the environment.

    ```R
    renv::restore()
    ```

4. **Run the RMarkdown file**: Open `XAI3.Rmd` in RStudio or your preferred R environment and knit the document to generate the analysis.
